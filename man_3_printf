.SH NAME

_printf - formatted output conversion

.SH SYNOPSIS

#include "holberton.h"

int _printf(const char *format, ...);

int converter(char modifier, va_list list);

int print_char(va_list list);

int print_str(va_list list);

int print_num(va_list list);

typedef struct converter

{

char mod;

/*va_list contains un list de variables*/

int (*f)(va_list list);

}

convert;

.SH DESCRIPTION

The functions in the _printf() produce output according to a format as described below. The function _printf() write output
to stdout, the standard output stream.

The _printf() function write the output under the control of a format string that specifies how subsequent arguments (or arguments
accessed via the variable-length argument facilities of stdarg()) are converted for output.

Format of the format string
The format string is a character string, beginning and ending in its initial shift state, if any. The format string is composed of zero or
more directives: ordinary characters (not %), which are copied unchanged to the output stream; and conversion specifications, each of which results
in fetching zero or more subsequent arguments.  Each conversion specification is introduced by the character %, and ends with a conversion specifier. In
between there may be (in this order) zero or more flags, an optional minimum field width, an optional precision and an optional length modifier

The overall syntax of a conversion specification is:

int converter(char modifier, va_list list)

Conversion specifiers

A character that specifies the type of conversion to be applied. The conversion specifiers and their meanings are:

d, i    The int argument is converted to signed decimal notation. The precision, if any, gives the minimum number of digits that must appear; if the converted value
requires fewer digits, it is padded on the left with zeros. The default precision is 1. When 0 is printed with an explicit precision 0, the output is empty.

c      If no l modifier is present, the int argument is converted to an unsigned char, and the resulting character is written.  If an l modifier is present, the wint_t
(wide character) argument is converted to a multibyte sequence by a call to the wcrtomb(3) function, with a conversion state starting in the initial state, and the resulting multibyte string is written.

s      If no l modifier is present: the const char * argument is expected to be a pointer to an array of character type (pointer to a string).  Characters from the array are
written up to (but not including) a terminating null byte ('\0'); if a precision is specified, no more than the number specified are written.  If a precision is given, no
null byte need be present; if the precision is not specified, or is greater than the size of the array, the array must contain a terminating null byte.

%      A '%' is written.  No argument is converted.  The complete conversion specification is '%%'.

.SH RETURN VALUE

Upon successful return, the function return the number of characters printed (excluding the null byte used to end output to strings).

If an output error is encountered, a negative value is returned.

.SH NOTES

Some programs imprudently rely on code such as the following:

typedef struct converter
{
char mod;
/*va_list contains un list de variables*/
int (*f)(va_list list);
}
convert;

The struct converter function especifies the conversion by using the char variable (char mod) and the function pointer (f) which accepts a list of variables and return an integer.
